* Exercise 2.2
* Write the following program.
 * The program will output 100 letters per line, on 10 lines. 
 * The first letter is always "I".
 * The letters will be generated with the following probabilities.  
 * P(c|ab) = 0.5 means that if the previous two letters are "ab" (in order), the probability of "c" being printed is 1/2.  
 * Here, " " indicates a space.)
 * P(_ | I) = 1
 * P(a | _) = 0.5
 * P(l | _) = 0.5
 * P(m | a) = 0.4
 * P(l | a) = 0.6
 * P(v | i) = 0.95
 * P(n | i) = 0.05
 * P(. | e) = 1
