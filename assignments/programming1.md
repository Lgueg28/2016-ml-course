Naïve Bayes Classification
--

Be advised that this assignment has multiple parts.  It is inadvisable to wait until the last few days to work on it.  If you're having trouble, use the message board and/or come to office hours.

* Download the Iris dataset.  (You can easily find this.)
* Split the data into 5% dev and 95% train sets for your experiments.  Include this in your submission.
* Write a Naïve Bayes classifier to predict the class of the plant based on the other features.
 * There are continuous values in the feature set.  Figure out how to handle this and incorporate the strategy into your classifier.  Justify your decision in your report.
* Convert the data to Vowpal Wabbit's format and run the same experiments with the loss function(s) of your choice, comparing the results.  (For this assignment, you may use Weka instead of VW if you wish.)
* Write a report according to the syllabus's guidelines.  Submit a zip (or tar.gz) file to Moodle with all of your materials.  
* Up to 10 point bonus: Add smoothing.
* If your classifier performs better/worse than expected, try to explain why.
* Your program should run "out-of-the-box."
* 

Hints for reports:

*  Your report should have have sections for the Introduction and Conclusion, and whatever you think is necessary in between. 
*  The report should be readable by someone who is not in the class.  I.e., the introductory sections should provide sufficient context for what you are doing and why.
*  Better analysis makes for a better paper.
*  Your report should be less than four pages.  Do not insert filler.  If you can say what you need to say in a page, then that is sufficient for this assignment.
